# memepaste
Alfred Workflow to paste the memes from your ~/meme folder

# Requirements

To get memepaste to work, you will need impbcopy into your /usr/local/bin/ folder. 

## Installing impbcopy
This is a good old tool that was created by Alec Jacobson, definitely recommend checking it out from his blog post [here](https://www.alecjacobson.com/weblog/?p=3816)

You can follow his blog post to install his tool or use the [script](install_pbcopy.sh) I provide in this repo, completely up to you!

To install impbcopy using my script, just run this command:
`$(curl )`

# FAQ

## "why can't you use pbcopy?!?"
I'm glad you've asked! If you have ever tried to use pbcopy for images, it's going to reference the file itself on your clipboard and it won't paste it as an image into the chats/documents/\<insertYourApplicationHere>.
